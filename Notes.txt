DATA STRUCTURES:
 - containers that allow us to combine pieces of data into a single structure
 - help us connect and group our data 


BUILT-IN DATA STRUCTURES:
List[,,]
Tuple(,,)
Dictionary{:,:}
Set{,,} - store a collection of unique items in an unordered manner
Deque[,,] - double-ended que; allow you to insert and remove data from both ends; similar to list


BIG-O NOTATION:
 - describes the complexity of an algorithm, independently of input; tells you how efficient an operation is
 - used to decide which data structure to use based on our needs

Constant Time Complexity or O(1) - time required by the algorithm is not dependent on the inputs size

Linear Time Complexity or O(n) - time required by the algorithm grows linearily with the size of input

Quadratic Time Complexity or O(n^2) - time required is proportional to square of the items in the collection


ARRAY:
 - like a row of seats in a movie theater
 - each seat can have data or be empty
 - counting starts at 0 (zero-based indexing)
 - a collection of elements where each item is identified with an index or key
 - python does not have a data structure called array, but has array-like data structures like list or tuple
